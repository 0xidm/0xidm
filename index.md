## Origin Story

I was building a startup at the local accelerator when I first heard discussion of "the DAO" - and I've been thinking about Ethereum ever since.

Shortly before the pandemic, I defended my dissertation on crowds and agent-based modeling.
I connected with a bunch of wonderful and likeminded degens on Discord throughout the isolating pandemic.
As a member of this community, I started applying my research to blockchain economies and governance.

By now, I've worked with numerous DeFi protocols and I'm full-time in the space.
